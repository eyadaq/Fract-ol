# Fractol

## Project Description

**Fractol** is a project from the 42 curriculum that focuses on the creation of fractals using C and the MiniLibX graphics library. The goal is to implement a program that visualizes popular fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set and Julia set, and allows users to interact with them through zooming, panning, and changing iterations. This project will improve your understanding of mathematical algorithms, complex numbers, and graphical rendering.

### Objective

The main objective of the project is to:

- Implement an interactive graphical program that displays fractals (Mandelbrot, Julia, etc.).
- Allow the user to zoom in/out and pan the view.
- Add interactivity such as changing the maximum iterations and other parameters affecting the fractal visualization.

### Key Requirements

- You must implement at least one fractal (e.g., Mandelbrot or Julia) and allow the user to navigate through it using keyboard and mouse inputs.
- The program must use the **MiniLibX** graphics library for rendering.
- The fractals should be rendered with proper mathematical formulas and iterations.
- Implement zooming, panning, and adjusting the maximum iterations through user interaction.
- Efficient memory management is required, especially when dealing with dynamically allocated arrays for rendering.
